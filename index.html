Welcome
========

Do you remember mspaint? A very small utility that you first learned to doodle on? Well, *js-paint* is the web version of it.

> Hope you love it more!

In upcoming days, there will be another page to look after the actual usage.

First beta version of this application will be launched 24th August. If everything goes right, by September 1, we would have it's first version out.
