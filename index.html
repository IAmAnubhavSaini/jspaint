  <h1>Welcome to JS Paint</h1>
  <p>  Do you remember mspaint? A very small utility that you first learned to doodle on? Well, js-paint is the web version of it.</p>
  <p class="emphasis">Hope you love it more!</p>
  <p>In upcoming days, there will be another page to look after the actual usage.</p>
  <p>First beta version of this application will be launched 24th August. If everything goes right, by September 1, we would have it's first version out.</p>
